abstract = {Forecasters have surmised that prominent mountain ranges and river valleys in eastern New York and western New England (e.g., Hudson and Mohawk River valleys; Adirondack, Catskill, Green, and Berkshire Mountains) affect convective initiation and subsequent severe weather distribution. The purpose of this research is to document the climatology of severe weather in this region with respect to the terrain and the synoptic-scale flow direction. The area of study was subdivided into overlapping 0.5° grid boxes, and the number of severe weather reports from the database (1950–98) was tabulated for each box. These severe weather reports were then normalized and contoured over a terrain map. A logarithmic correction factor was applied to the data in order to minimize potential population bias effects. The results of this correction were compared with cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes (independent of population bias) from 1989 to 1998 (1990 missing) for severe weather days in the same region. The severe weather and CG lightning database also was stratified by 700-hPa flow direction into northwest and southwest flow regimes to see if subtle terrain influences on the severe weather distribution could be detected. Regions where the CG lightning and severe weather stratifications agree well include the southern Adirondacks, Berkshires, and the Litchfield Hills of northwest Connecticut. Regions where discrepancies exist between the two stratifications include the Catskills and the mid–Hudson valley. The results of both severe weather and lightning stratifications show that there are preferred regions of upstate New York and western New England for both CG lightning and severe weather to occur depending on the 700-hPa flow direction.},

abstract={Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, elongated, synoptic jets of water vapor that play important roles in the global water cycle. The continually developing Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally as Elongated Targets (tARget) algorithm identifies AR objects at individual time steps based on thresholding integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and other requirements, and tracks each AR object in time and space. Building on previous versions of tARget, this paper discusses further refinements to the algorithm to better handle ARs in tropical and polar areas, as well as ``zonal'' ARs which the previous versions of the algorithm were not designed to capture. This further regionally refined algorithm is applied to the ERA5 reanalysis over 1940--2023 at 6{\thinspace}h intervals and a 0.25{\textdegree}{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}0.25{\textdegree} horizontal resolution. The AR detection results are evaluated in terms of key AR characteristics. We anticipate this regionally refined global AR database will aid further understanding of ARs such as AR process studies, evaluation of AR simulations and predictions, and assessment of climate change impacts on ARs.},

abstract = {Abstract Gridded hourly precipitation observations over the conterminous U.S., from 1948 to 2002, are analyzed to determine climatological characteristics of storm precipitation totals. Despite generally lower hourly intensities, precipitation totals along the U.S. West Coast (USWC) are comparable to those in southeast U.S. (SEUS). Storm durations, more so than hourly intensities, strongly modulate precipitation-total variability over the USWC, where the correlation coefficients between storm durations and storm totals range from 0.7 to 0.9. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) contribute 30–50\% of annual precipitation on the USWC and make such large contributions to extreme storms that 60–100\% of the most extreme storms, i.e., storms with precipitation-total return intervals longer than 2 years, are associated with ARs. These extreme storm totals are more strongly tied to storm durations than to storm hourly or average intensities, emphasizing the importance of AR persistence to extreme storms on the USWC.},

abstract = {Abstract Hurricane Helene was one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in American history. The storm was responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, making it the deadliest hurricane since Hurricane Katrina. Understanding the people and places impacted by Hurricane Helene will remain important for years to come.  This work establishes a baseline for future measurement of Hurricane Helene’s impact with a new dataset, the Census Bureau’s Assessment, Recovery, and Evaluation Datasets or CAREs. CAREs is a curation of data from multiple federal sources, including the Census Bureau, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This allows data users to find relevant information about the population, disaster exposure, and recovery, all in one source.  Several short case studies illustrate CAREs’ value by examining the relationship between disaster impacts and household registrations for FEMA assistance. The analysis shows clear associations between exposure, recovery assistance, population characteristics, and recovery. One study shows a correlation between DOE power outage estimates and household registrations for aid from FEMA’s Individual Assistance Program. This link between power outages and program participation highlights how disaster exposure influences recovery needs and could be used to forecast future registrations. Forecasting registration patterns could ensure that policy goals are met in allocating resources and pinpointing areas with greater recovery needs.  These insights can help agencies target recovery resources to places that may need additional attention. It also demonstrates the value of standardizing diverse datasets for public analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract This Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) technical report is intended to provide local communities and agencies with a thorough understanding of the Hurricane Helene Flood Event in September 2024. This Post-Flood Report documents the meteorological conditions of the storm, the hydraulic characteristics of the flood event, the factors that contributed to the severity of the flood, and information on the collected high-water marks after the flood. This report will serve the Nashville District and the region as a reference tool for future project planning and will advance the Corps’ mission for the protection of life and property in the Cumberland River and Tennessee River Basins. Thisreport is also intended to improve public awareness of this event, thereby potentially reducing the consequences of future flood events. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida as a Category Four hurricane on the evening of September 26. Preceding the hurricane, a slow-moving front produced heavy rainfall across the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachian Mountains on September 25 - 26. This storm front produced 2 to 7 inches of rain in East Tennessee and western North Carolina before rainfall associated with Helene hit the area on September 27. By midnight on September 27, the 3-day total rainfall accumulation was between 10 to over 24 inches in western North Carolina, causing extreme flooding along many rivers and watersheds. Many of these rivers, including the French Broad River, Pigeon River, and Nolichucky Riverfeed into East Tennessee from North Carolina, so although less rainfall occurred there, the flooding was still extreme.  Significant, widespread, and record-breaking flooding occurred across the mountains of western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southern Virginia, bringing catastrophic changes to the landscape in some areas. The disaster damaged or destroyed numerous roads and bridges, dislodged buildings, and left communities devastated. The images on the next page give just a couple of the areas impacted by the flooding. The region's steep, mountainous terrainamplified the crisis as flash flooding struck with little warning, allowing minimal time for evacuation. Normally small, shallow streams transformed into vast, valley-spanning floodplains, highlighting the unprecedented scale of the event. The USACE coordinated with local, state, and federal representatives and agencies to complete a post-flood mission in the Nashville District area of responsibility (AOR). The goal of this mission was to collect High-Water Marks (HWMs) and gather as much flood-related data as possible in the impacted areas. 2,587 HWMs were collected and surveyed as part of this mission. The HWM collection teams covered 19 counties and 115 streams across Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.},

abstract = {The complex terrain at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys of New York has an impact on the development and evolution of severe convection in the region. Specifically, previous research has concluded that terrain-channeled flow in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys likely contributes to increased low-level wind shear and instability in the valleys during severe weather events such as the historic 31 May 1998 event that produced a strong (F3) tornado in Mechanicville, New York. The goal of this study is to further examine the impact of terrain channeling on severe convection by analyzing a high-resolution WRF Model simulation of the 31 May 1998 event. Results from the simulation suggest that terrain-channeled flow resulted in the localized formation of an enhanced low-level moisture gradient, resembling a dryline, at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys. East of this boundary, the environment was characterized by stronger low-level wind shear and greater low-level moisture and instability, increasing tornadogenesis potential. A simulated supercell intensified after crossing the boundary, as the larger instability and streamwise vorticity of the low-level inflow was ingested into the supercell updraft. These results suggest that terrain can have a key role in producing mesoscale inhomogeneities that impact the evolution of severe convection. Recognition of these terrain-induced boundaries may help in anticipating where the risk of severe weather may be locally enhanced.},

abstract = {Many studies have aimed to identify novel storm characteristics that are indicative of current or future severe weather potential using a combination of ground-based radar observations and severe reports. However, this is often done on a small scale using limited case studies on the order of tens to hundreds of storms due to how time-intensive this process is. Herein, we introduce the GridRad-Severe dataset, a database including ∼100 severe weather days per year and upward of 1.3 million objectively tracked storms from 2010 to 2019. Composite radar volumes spanning objectively determined, report-centered domains are created for each selected day using the GridRad compositing technique, with dates objectively determined using report thresholds defined to capture the highest-end severe weather days from each year, evenly distributed across all severe report types (tornadoes, severe hail, and severe wind). Spatiotemporal domain bounds for each event are objectively determined to encompass both the majority of reports and the time of convection initiation. Severe weather reports are matched to storms that are objectively tracked using the radar data, so the evolution of the storm cells and their severe weather production can be evaluated. Herein, we apply storm mode (single-cell, multicell, or mesoscale convective system storms) and right-moving supercell classification techniques to the dataset, and revisit various questions about severe storms and their bulk characteristics posed and evaluated in past work. Additional applications of this dataset are reviewed for possible future studies.},

journal = {Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences Honors Program},
number = {1},
url = {https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cas-daes-honors/1},
abstract = {Although uncommon as compared to other regions of the United States, the Northeast can experience strong EF3+ tornadoes,
some of which have had profound impacts on the region. Due to the prominent topography of the region, many of the tornadic supercells
occurring in the region experience a sizeable change in elevation throughout their track. This study seeks to better understand the impacts
of local topography on the intensity and overall progression of a locally significant tornadic event: the Turin, NY EF3 of 2023. With
consideration of previous studies involving the effects of terrain on tornados, we broke terrain effects on the storm into two factors: valley
channeling; a valley favorably oriented to the boundary layer wind direction can locally back winds, increasing low-level shear/helicity
and thus convective intensity, as well as vortex stretching, a storm’s descent down terrain such as off a hill can stretch and spin up the
storm’s mesocyclone, and vice versa for ascent of terrain. Model simulations of the Turin supercell were carried out using the Weather
and Research Forecasting (WRF) model to test the effects of various terrain configurations on the strength and progression of the storm,
providing an in-depth analysis of both the valley channeling and vortex stretching terrain effects. It was found that the combination of both
effects contributed to the intensity of the Turin tornado, as the storm was noticeably weaker in the absence of these effects. It was noted
that terrain effects acted in addition to other effects, such as storm mergers},
